<h3 id="data-94-spring-2021">Data 94, Spring 2021</h3>

<p>This homework is due on <strong>Thursday, April 29th, 2021.</strong> Submission instructions for this assignment are a little different (nothing is uploaded to Gradescope); read the instructions carefully.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this final homework of the semester, you will create a public-facing website with text and visualizations that you will create on your own, using a dataset that you will choose on your own. You‚Äôll be able to share this website link with anyone you want, and you will submit the assignment by posting your website link on Ed (<a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3251/discussion/391281">in this thread</a>) for the rest of the class to see.</p>

<p>As you can see, we aren‚Äôt distributing this assignment to you in the form of a Jupyter notebook. Instead, we‚Äôre providing you with all of the instructions here. <strong>Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì even though this assignment looks quite different than those prior, we‚Äôve designed it to be relatively straightforward and not that time-consuming.</strong> We promise you‚Äôll enjoy it! üéâ</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a brief summary of each part of the assignment, along with a time estimate.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#part1">Finding a dataset and creating a visualization (1-2 hours)</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#part2">Creating a GitHub account and publishing a blank website (~15 minutes)</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#part3">Copying your content to your website (~30 minutes)</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#part4">Submitting your work (~10 minutes)</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#part5">(Optional) Adding more content</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#grading">Grading</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, we will show you screenshots from an example website that we built. The links to this website and the corresponding repo (the term ‚Äúrepo‚Äù will be explained later on) are below. <strong>You cannot use this dataset.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Website link: <a href="https://bigbilly23.github.io/2024-polls/">https://bigbilly23.github.io/2024-polls/</a></li>
  <li>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/bigbilly23/2024-polls">https://github.com/bigbilly23/2024-polls</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are links to the website and GitHub repo created in Lecture 34. <strong>You cannot use this dataset either.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Website link: <a href="https://bigbilly23.github.io/weather-chicago-sd/">https://bigbilly23.github.io/weather-chicago-sd/</a></li>
  <li>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/bigbilly23/weather-chicago-sd">https://github.com/bigbilly23/weather-chicago-sd</a></li>

<h2 id="part-1--finding-a-dataset-and-creating-a-visualization-">Part 1 ‚Äì Finding a Dataset and Creating a Visualization üé®</h2>

<p>Note: We estimated that this part may take slightly longer than the others because it may take a while to find a dataset that you‚Äôre interested in and can make interesting visualizations with. You should not spend 1-2 hours writing code in this part.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a dataset you want to work with in the CSV format and download it to your computer. Slides 13 and 14 of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wA1taEpdonSa-WTuDriNwK6vWOMHewj14nejHZBlFHc/edit#slide=id.gd34f647e78_0_0">Lecture 33</a> list several potential sources.
    <ul>
      <li>Try your best not to overlap datasets with others in the class, though if this happens by coincidence that‚Äôs fine. Don‚Äôt use a dataset we‚Äôve already used this semester in this class and don‚Äôt use the dataset in the example we linked above (2024 elections polls).</li>
      <li>You may want to find more than one dataset in the event you aren‚Äôt able to make any interesting visualizations using your first choice.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt seek datasets with latitudes and longitudes, since unfortunately the instructions we‚Äôll provide today will only work ‚Äúregular‚Äù visualizations, <strong>not maps</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the steps in Slides 16-18 of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wA1taEpdonSa-WTuDriNwK6vWOMHewj14nejHZBlFHc/edit#slide=id.gd34f64800a_2_13">Lecture 33</a> to create a new notebook with the necessary import statements and upload your dataset to your DataHub.
    <ul>
      <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Table.read_table</code>, load in your dataset and save it to a variable. You should now be good to go to perform any analysis you want.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get familiarized with the data.
    <ul>
      <li>There are no concrete steps here; the work you do here will depend on your data. For example, you may want to <code class="highlighter-rouge">group</code> to see the distribution of a particular column, or draw a <code class="highlighter-rouge">scatter</code> plot to understand the relationship between two numerical columns. <strong>We‚Äôre not grading you on this step, it‚Äôs more just for you to understand the data you‚Äôve chosen.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create at least one of the following types of visualizations using your data. Feel free to create more than one (perhaps once you‚Äôve finished the whole assignment), but only one is needed for full credit on the assignment. Don‚Äôt forget to give your visualizations appropriate axes labels and titles (you may lose points if you don‚Äôt). This is especially important here since your visualization will be standing alone on a website without code surrounding it.
    <ul>
      <li>Grouped bar chart.</li>
      <li>Overlaid histogram.</li>
      <li>Scatter plot with labels or sizes or colors for each point.</li>
      <li>Line plot with multiple lines.</li>
      <li><strong>No maps</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a Markdown cell in your notebook, write a sentence or two describing your dataset and where you found it (include a link to the website where you downloaded the CSV from). Write another short paragraph about the parts of the data you chose to visualize and any observations you made from the visualization(s) you created. We‚Äôre not looking for essays; don‚Äôt write more than ~120 words total across the two paragraphs.
    <ul>
      <li>To include links in Markdown, use this syntax: <code class="highlighter-rouge">[text to display](URL)</code>. So for example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">[this goes to Google](http://google.com)</code> becomes <a href="http://google.com">this goes to Google</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a href="../other/part-1-ex.html">At this point, your notebook may look something like this example here</a>. Scroll to the very bottom to see some example paragraphs.</p>

<p>Great! Now you have the information you need for your website. The hard part is done.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="part2"></a></p>
<h2 id="part-2--creating-a-github-account-and-a-blank-website-">Part 2 ‚Äì Creating a GitHub Account and a Blank Website üíª</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> account (go to the site and click ‚ÄúSign Up‚Äù in the top right).
    <ul>
      <li>Your username is up to you, but it may be a good idea to choose something professional since you might use this account in the future for something else. Your website URL will contain your username.</li>
      <li>After entering your credentials, it may ask you questions like ‚ÄúWhat kind of work do you do, mainly?‚Äù. You can skip these; scroll all the way to the bottom and continue.</li>
      <li>You‚Äôll then need to verify your email address.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new <strong>repository</strong>. It may prompt you to do this after verifying your email; if it doesn‚Äôt, you can click the circular cat logo in the top left of your screen and then click the green button in the left pane.
    <ul>
      <li>A repository, or repo for short, is like a folder for a project.</li>
      <li>You will need to select a name for the repository. Name it something related to the dataset that you visualized in the previous part, since your repo name will end up in the URL of your website. <strong>Don‚Äôt</strong> name it ‚Äú94-homework‚Äù or something like that.</li>
      <li>Make sure to select <strong>Public</strong> and <strong>Add a README file.</strong> Overall, your settings should look like this (but with a different username and repo name):</li>
    </ul>
    <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/repo.png" width="500" />
 </div>
  </li>
  <li>Enable <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for your repo. GitHub Pages is the feature we will use to create our website. Follow these steps:
    <ol>
      <li>From this page (the main page of your repo), click ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù.
        <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/mainpage.png" width="500" />
 </div>
      </li>
      <li>Click ‚ÄúPages‚Äù in the menu on the left (it should be towards the bottom).</li>
      <li>Under ‚ÄúSource‚Äù, change ‚ÄúNone‚Äù to ‚Äúmain‚Äù. Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.</li>
      <li>Under ‚ÄúTheme Chooser‚Äù, click ‚ÄúChoose a theme‚Äù. It will allow you to choose one of several themes; pick the one you like the most and click ‚ÄúSelect theme‚Äù. If you end up not liking your choice, you can always come back to this menu and change the theme, so don‚Äôt worry. <strong>Note:</strong> If you are brought to a page that has you try and edit your file (it may say something like ‚ÄúEdit new file‚Äù), just click ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù.</li>
      <li>After you follow these steps, your site will be public. You will be shown its URL; it will be in the form <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;your github username&gt;.github.io/&lt;your repo name&gt;</code>. <strong>Keep a tab open with your website while working on the rest of the assignment.</strong>
        <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/showurl.png" width="500" />
 </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="part3"></a></p>
<h2 id="part-3--building-your-website-">Part 3 ‚Äì Building Your Website üî®</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate back to the main page for your repo by clicking its name in the top-left of your screen. It should now look something like this, though the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> might not have very much in it.
    <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/afterpages.png" width="500" />
 </div>
  </li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file is where you‚Äôll put all of the content for your website (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> denotes Markdown, the format we discussed at the start of the semester). <strong>To edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> (both now and moving forward), you‚Äôll need to click the pencil icon.</strong> (In the screenshot above, it‚Äôs right under the ‚Äú4 minutes ago‚Äù text.)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You should be brought to an interface that allows you to edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>.</strong></li>
      <li>Under the hood, GitHub Pages uses a library called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to convert your <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> to the standard HTML file format.</li>
      <li>There‚Äôs another file in your repo, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> ‚Äì it serves to tell GitHub Pages which theme you chose (amongst other information). You will not edit it in this assignment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Delete everything currently in <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> and enter the text that you‚Äôd like to put on your website. Specifically:
    <ul>
      <li>Put a heading at the top of the file (using <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>) that relates to your visualization and write your name on the second line.</li>
      <li>Copy the two paragraphs you wrote in Part 1 to the file.</li>
      <li>Write <code class="highlighter-rouge">TODO: Put visualization here</code> where you‚Äôd like to insert your visualization. There‚Äôs a good chance that this goes between the two paragraphs above, but it doesn‚Äôt have to.</li>
      <li>This is the bare minimum required, but you can add other text/placeholders to your site too, if there are other things you want to write about or other visualizations you want to show. (In Part 5, you‚Äôll see how to add other types of content to your site.)</li>
      <li>Tip: To space things out vertically, put <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code> on a new line on its own. (This is the equivalent of hitting enter several times in a Word doc.)</li>
      <li>At this point, the text in <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> might look something like this:</li>
    </ul>
    <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/edit1.png" width="700" />
 </div>
  </li>
  <li>Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click ‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù.
    <ul>
      <li>You can think of committing as saving your changes.</li>
      <li>You can add a commit message if you‚Äôd like, saying something like ‚Äúadded text to website‚Äù. (This is generally good practice.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After committing, open your website once again. The changes may take a few minutes to propagate but they will eventually appear. Here‚Äôs what our example site looks like; we chose the Cayman theme so your site may look different (and that‚Äôs fine).
    <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/part3novis.png" width="400" />
 </div>
  </li>
  <li>Now your website is close, but it‚Äôs missing the pizzazz ‚Äì your visualization! Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôll get your visualization from your notebook to your website. Go back to your notebook that you created in Part 1.
    <ol>
      <li>Assign your visualization to a variable name and add the argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">show = False</code> (just like in Homework 7 and 8). Remember, no maps allowed.
        <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/fig.png" width="500" />
 </div>
      </li>
      <li>In a new cell, run the following two lines. <code class="highlighter-rouge">fig</code> is a placeholder for the variable name of your visualization, so if you used a different variable name, change <code class="highlighter-rouge">fig</code> too.
        <div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">plotly</span>
 <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">plotly</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">offline</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fig</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">include_plotlyjs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output_type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'div'</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Copy the output of that code (it should start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> and end with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/div&gt;</code>, and be pretty long and ugly).</li>
      <li>Go back to GitHub and edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>. Replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">TODO: Put visualization here</code> with the nasty looking code you just copied. Do this separately for each visualization you want to put on your website.</li>
      <li><strong>Before</strong> the code for your first visualization, put the following code on its own on a line:
        <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Make sure to commit your changes after (a good commit message here would be ‚Äúadded visualization‚Äù). At this point, your <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> might look something like this:
        <div align="center">
 <img src="../images/aftervis.png" width="600" />
 </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>After committing in the previous stage, refresh your website until it loads. If you‚Äôre happy with the result, congrats! All of the ugly code you copied from your notebook has been converted into your original interactive visualization. At this point, feel free to tweak things. One suggestion is to change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">height</code> of your image in your notebook before exporting. (You can repeat the previous step as many times as you want.) As long as you have these essentials, you can add whatever else you want to your website (see the bonus part for fun possibilities).

<p>At this point, you‚Äôre ready to submit. There is an optional ‚ÄúPart 5‚Äù below that shows you how you can add additional components (like videos or Instagram posts) to your site. You‚Äôre free to submit first and then work on the optional parts, or vice versa. You also are not obligated to look at the optional part at all (but it‚Äôs fun!).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instead of submitting anything to Gradescope, you‚Äôre going to upload the notebook you created in Part 1 to GitHub too! Here‚Äôs how:
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate back to your notebook, save, go to ‚ÄúKernel &gt; Restart &amp; Run All‚Äù, and save again.</li>
      <li>Go to ‚ÄúFile &gt; Download as &gt; Notebook (.ipynb)‚Äù. This will download your notebook to your computer.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the main page of your repo, and click ‚ÄúAdd file‚Äù then ‚ÄúUpload files‚Äù. Then click ‚ÄúChoose your files‚Äù and select the notebook you just downloaded.</li>
      <li>After the progress bar completes, commit your changes. After these steps, your repo should look like this; <a href="https://github.com/bigbilly23/2024-polls">here‚Äôs a link</a> to the finalized repo for our example.</li>
    </ol>

 </div>
  </li>
  <li>In <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3251/discussion/391281">this post on Ed</a>, post two links: the link to your website, and the link to your repo.

  </li>
  <li>That‚Äôs it ‚Äì congrats on finishing! Make sure to take a look at others‚Äô websites.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="optional-part-5--adding-more-content-">(Optional) Part 5 ‚Äì Adding More Content üßë‚Äçüíª</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nothing in this part is required or expected of you. It may interest you, however!</p>

<p>Many of your favorite websites make it surprisingly easy to embed their content into your own website. Here, we‚Äôll point you to some examples. Essentially these all work the same ‚Äì you tell the website you want to embed their content (e.g. a tweet or an Instagram post) into your website, they give you a piece of code that does it for you, and you paste that code into your website where you want it. That‚Äôs it!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tweets</strong>. On the Twitter website, click the three dots at the top right of any tweet, then click ‚ÄúEmbed Tweet‚Äù. A new site will appear; click ‚ÄúCopy Code‚Äù to copy the necessary code, and paste that code somewhere in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> (but not in the middle of the long visualization code).</li>
  <li><strong>YouTube Videos</strong>. On the page of a YouTube video, click ‚ÄúShare‚Äù, then click ‚ÄúEmbed‚Äù. Copy the code that appears and paste it somewhere in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>. You‚Äôll notice that the code has numbers for ‚Äúwidth‚Äù and ‚Äúheight‚Äù; feel free to change these.</li>
  <li><strong>Songs</strong>. Follow <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/generate/embed/">these</a> instructions for Spotify and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gw/guide/music-web/apdm0783785d/web">these</a> instructions for Apple Music. Other sites will have similar instructions.</li>
  <li><strong>Instagram Posts</strong>. On the Instagram website, click the three dots at the top right of any post, then click ‚ÄúEmbed‚Äù and then ‚ÄúCopy Embed Code‚Äù. Copy the code that appears and paste it somewhere in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> (beware, the code may be a little long).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of an embedded Instagram post.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="../images/ig.png" width="600" />
</div>

<p>If there are other sites you want to embed content from, just Google ‚Äú(name of site) embed‚Äù and you‚Äôll likely find a way to copy the necessary code from their website into your website.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">here</a> for how to add other elements to your website, like images.</p>
