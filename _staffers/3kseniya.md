Hey, I’m Kseniya! I have recently graduated with CogSci and am currently pursuing a 5th Year MIDS degree at iSchool. In my first semester at Cal as a transfer student I *accidentally* took Data 8 and fell in love with Data Science. Over the last three years I’ve been developing and teaching short intro to DS courses like modules and connectors at the Division of Data Sciences. I am super excited to work with you this semester!
