Hello! My name is Ian (he/they) and I am a Masters student in Information & Management Systems at the iSchool. Before graduate school, I studied microbial biology and media studies. My interests are in STEM education, data science, and info policy, with a focus on making the information sciences more accessible for people without experience in computing. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions in office hours or via email!
