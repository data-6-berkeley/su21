I am so excited to be teaching you all this summer! I will be an EECS Masters student starting this fall, where I will be focusing on Computer Science and Data Science Education. When I'm not teaching, I follow football, basketball, and baseball seasonally and I love to travel when I get the chance. Always feel free to contact me via email about any questions you may have about the course this semester!
